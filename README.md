# RandomRestaurantPicker
An android app that pulls your location information and randomly chooses a restaurant near you. Google maps will then open and bring you there automatically.
# Description
On the main activity screen you will see a button that will bring you to a random restaurant selected for you. The name, location, and picture url's are
pulled from the yelp API. The picture URL is then downloaded asynchronously and displayed. Once the display is loaded, you can then press a button at
the bottom of the screen to open google maps with the destination already set.
